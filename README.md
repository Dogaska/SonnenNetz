# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

For local installation and work follow the following steps:

- Install  node.js from the following link for your system. (https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
- Clone the repo into your local machine.
- [cd frontend] into main project folder.
- Create a [vite] project running the following command [npm create vite@latest].
- Select the [React] among the options in the next steps.
- Select the [Typescript] among the options in the next steps.
- Also, you need to install some other node.js packages.
    -  [npm i react-router-dom] (installs a package from Node Package Manager)
- As a last step run the following command and copy-paste the provided url in the terminal to your browser. [npm run dev]
- If there is an error let us now :)
