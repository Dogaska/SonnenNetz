# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Environment Setup (for Linux) 

1. Installation of node.js and npm (node package manager)
    Check if they have already installed.
   '''
    node -v
    npm -v
   '''
   If not installed install Node.js from this link:
        https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager
   If not installed install Node Package Manager using the following command:
   '''
   npm install
   '''
2. Pull the repo into your local machine.
   '''
   git pull https://github.com/Dogaska/SonnenNetz.git
   '''
   Then cd into the main project folder:
   '''
   cd frontend
   '''
3. Create a vite project 
   '''
   npm create vite@latest 
   '''
4.  Try to run the project in the dev mode and copy and paste the provided url in the terminal to your browser.
    '''
    npm run dev
    '''
    If you are getting an error install the following code and try to run "run dev npm" again:
    '''
    npm i react-router-dom
    '''
Finally, if there is still an error don't hesitate to ask us :)
